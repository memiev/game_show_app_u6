# Guess The Word
About this Project

In this project, you'll create a browser version of “Wheel of Success”, a word guessing game where players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase.
Using Javascript, you’ll create an array of phrases and write functions to choose a random phrase from that array.
Each time the player guesses a letter, if the letter is in the phrase, you’ll update the game board with the chosen letters.
A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. If the letter they chose isn’t in the phrase, you’ll remove one of the player’s 5 hearts.
If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen will display. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen will display.
